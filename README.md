# Pneumonia-CNN-Classifiert

This project aims to develop a deep learning tool that can quickly and accurately
classify X-ray images of lungs as normal, pneumonia, or COVID-19 cases. With
the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for accurate and efficient diagnosis is pressing,
and traditional methods can be time-consuming. We are using convolutional neu-
ral networks (CNNs) to develop the model, and the input is an X-ray image with
a classification label as the output. We have already achieved significant progress
in creating a baseline model with accuracy of 92.8 percent and a rudimentary pri-
mary model with 94 percent.
